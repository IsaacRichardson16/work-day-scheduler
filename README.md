# work-day-scheduler

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

This Daily Work Planner lets you put in events for specific work hours of the day. It is also color coded with grey being past hours, red being the current hour, and green being future. 



I want to thank Elizabeth Hennessy for her help. 

I also referenced the Youtube video "How to use Local Storage in JavaScript" by dcode
